# Multilingual

Multilingual extension for [Symphony CMS][1].

**NOTE:** this branch represents the not yet officially released **version 2.0** of multilingual. It is currently in beta-state, but should run pretty stable by now. Wanna know more about this update? Have a look [at the roadmap][2].

I'm currently working on the documentation for version 2.0 - you can have a look at the current state [here][3].
